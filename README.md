# Learning Julia

This is not really meant as a tutorial, more like my thought process when learning Julia. I watched a few tutorials, sat down with a notebook and my favorite search engine, and started trying things writing down my thoughts and errors.

If any of this is useful, go nuts. If not, stay sane.
